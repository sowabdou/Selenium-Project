Selenium Framework
This Selenium-based framework is built using Java, Maven, TestNG, and IntelliJ IDEA for automated testing of web applications. It follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for maintainability and scalability.

Prerequisites
Before setting up the framework, make sure you have the following tools installed:

Java 8+: Required for running Selenium WebDriver and Maven.
Maven: Used to manage project dependencies.
IntelliJ IDEA: IDE for development.
Selenium WebDriver: Already included in the project dependencies.
TestNG: The testing framework used for organizing and running tests.

Setup
Clone the repository: https://github.com/sowabdou/Selenium-Project.git

Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA:

Launch IntelliJ IDEA and click on Open.
Navigate to the folder where the repository was cloned, and open the project.
Install dependencies using Maven:

IntelliJ IDEA will automatically detect the Maven pom.xml file and download all the necessary dependencies. If it doesn’t automatically download them, you can manually trigger it by following these steps:

Click on View -> Tool Windows -> Maven.
In the Maven tool window, click on the Refresh button to download all dependencies.

Usage
Running Tests in IntelliJ IDEA
Right-click on the test method or class: In the Project view, navigate to the test class or method you want to run.

Choose Run 'TestName': IntelliJ will execute the test with TestNG.

Running All Tests:
You can run the entire suite of tests using TestNG configuration in IntelliJ IDEA:

Right-click on testng.xml and select Run 'testng.xml'.
Alternatively, you can run all tests using Maven, from terminal, run:
mvn test

Explanation:
1. src/main/java/:
This folder contains the core Java code and business logic of the framework.

pages/:
This is where the Page Object Model (POM) classes are stored. Each class in this folder corresponds to a specific page in your application under test.
BasePage.java: The base class for all Page Object classes, providing common functionality that can be shared across all pages.
ContactUsPage.java: Represents the Contact Us page and contains elements and actions specific to this page.
LoginPage.java: Represents the Login page and contains login-specific methods and elements.
ProductsPage.java: Contains elements and methods for interacting with the product listing page.
RegisterPage.java: Contains elements and methods for interacting with the registration page.
TestCasesPage.java: Could be a placeholder for any custom test case pages or specific page logic related to tests.
2. src/test/data/:
This folder holds any external test data or configuration files needed for the tests.

credentials.json: A JSON file that could contain user credentials for login tests (e.g., username, password).
testFile.txt: A placeholder text file used for trrdting contact form.
3. src/test/java/:
This folder contains the test scripts and is where you define your actual test cases.

testCases/:
Contains the individual test classes that contain the actual TestNG test cases.
BaseTest.java: The base class for setting up WebDriver, configuration, and common utilities for all tests.
ContactUsTest.java: Test cases that validate the functionality of the Contact Us page.
LoginTest.java: Test cases that validate the login process.
ProductsTest.java: Test cases for validating product-related functionalities.
RegisterTest.java: Test cases for validating the registration process.
TestCasesTest.java: Could be an additional file to organize and run a variety of other specific tests.

4. target/:
This folder is created by Maven when building the project. It contains compiled classes, reports, and other build-related files. 
surefire-reports/: Contains the reports generated by the Maven Surefire plugin (TestNG reports for test execution).
